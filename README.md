# Optimizing Multispectral Transmission Images for Early Breast Cancer Screening using CNN-AE

This project implements a Convolutional Autoencoder (CNN-AE) to denoise multispectral transmission images, which is crucial for early breast cancer screening. The model learns to reconstruct clean images from noisy multispectral images, improving image clarity for accurate analysis.

## Detailed Description

## Features
- **CNN-AE Model**: A convolutional autoencoder that denoises multispectral images.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance evaluation using PSNR, RMSE, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
- **Simple Workflow**: End-to-end pipeline for training, evaluation, and testing with example scripts.

## Installation
If using Conda, create an environment as follows:
conda create -n cnn_ae_env python=3.7
conda activate cnn_ae_env
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- CNN_AE_Model.py

- Main file containing the Convolutional Autoencoder model architecture, training loop, and evaluation procedures.
CNN_AE_Model.py
- Script for training the model. It loads the dataset, initializes the model, and begins the training process and  It calculates metrics like PSNR, RMSE, Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Registration Time to assess the model's performance.

Directory for storing the dataset. This is where you should place the raw dataset images.
## Usage
### Prepare the Dataset
The dataset for this project contains multispectral images at different wavelengths. For example, images at 600nm, 620, 670nm, and 760nm wavelengths are stored in separate directories in the dataset directory. 

After running the CNN_AE_Model.py script, the resultant denoised images will be saved in directories corresponding to their respective wavelengths. To maintain clarity and ensure proper organization, create separate directories with the same names as the input wavelength directories (e.g., 600nm, 620nm, etc.) for storing the processed output images.
This repository has the dataset having raw images and processed denoised images samples.

Note: The dataset is private, and access can be obtained by contacting the author at [zhangtao@tju.edu.cn](zhangtao@tju.edu.cn).

### Train the Model
To train the Convolutional Autoencoder (CNN-AE) model, run the CNN_AE_Model.py script in your Python environment. This script includes both the model architecture and the training loop.
To start the training, run:
python CNN_AE_Model.py

After training the model, you will get the evaluation performance using metrics like PSNR, RMSE, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and Registration Time.
